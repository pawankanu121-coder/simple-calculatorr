## 🛠 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter:

   * First number
   * Second number
   * Operator (+, -, *, /)

2. Based on the chosen operator, it performs the calculation:

| Operator | Operation      |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +      | Addition       |
| -      | Subtraction    |
| *      | Multiplication |
| /      | Division       |

3. If an invalid operator is entered, the program prints:

   
   invalid choice
