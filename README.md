Here is a clean, professional, and properly formatted *README.md* for your file *college calulator.py*, written fully in Markdown:

# 🧮 College Calculator (Python CLI)

A simple command-line based calculator built using Python.
This program performs basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — based on user input.
# How to work
The program asks the user to input:

First number
Second number
An operator (+, -, *, /)
Based on the user's chosen operator, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.

If an invalid operator is entered, the program displays an error message.

💻 Code Overview
a = int(input("enter first number : "))
b = int(input("enter second number : "))
c = str(input("choose the operator (+,-,*,/) : "))
if c == '+':
    print("addition =",a+b)
elif c == '-':
    print("subtraction =",a-b)
elif c == '*':
    print("multiplication =",a*b)
elif c == '/':
    print("division =",a/b)
else:
    print("invalid choice")
